### About the Pack

This pack focuses on the City Trial mode of Kirby Air Ride, but there could be scattered updates to other content in the game. Quinton used the "trace bitmap" tool of the vector graphics program Inkscape to vectorize original game textures and xBRZ scaling for the small, multicolored star icons.
