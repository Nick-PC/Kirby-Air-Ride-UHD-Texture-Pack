This pack contains retextures averaging 8x original size for the entire city area of City Trial mode.  Most of the pack is a repackaged combination of excellent contributions from members of the Dolphin Forum community.  Go to the [wiki](https://github.com/quinton-ashley/Kirby_Air_Ride_UHD_Texture_Pack/wiki/Screenshots) to see screenshots!

### Contributions

kilerbomb (I renamed most files so they can work with the new Dolphin texture format)<br>
Guitar_Bro (I used his original SVG files to export larger png textures for parts of the city and also included the legendary pieces HUD textures and menu textures unaltered)<br>
gameboy96 (I included his items and some HUD textures, unaltered)<br>

### About the Pack

This pack focuses on the City Trial mode of Kirby Air Ride.  I do not have any intentions of retexturing or upscaling the rest of the game or doing any additional work on this pack.  If you would like to take over this project simply PM me on the Dolphin Forums.  I used the "trace bitmap" tool of the vector graphics program Inkscape to vectorize original game textures.  I also used xBRZ scaling for all the star icons.
